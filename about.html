                Hi there! My name <b>Fayz Siddiqui</b>. I am a 3rd year <b>Computer Science</b> student, studying at the <i>University of Edinburgh</i>. 
        <br><br>
                I grew up in Glasgow and have always had a variety of passions and interests; my main three being computers, music and sport.
            </p>

        <div class="textbox" style="width:87vw; height:auto;">
            <p> 
                I started learning to code when I was 13 in high school, learning scratch and basic python functions. 
                I really discovered my love for computer science through my school assignments. 
                I loved being given programming problems to solve, and then going on to help anyone who needed it.
                I created my first full project from scratch when I was 18, creating a very basic monopoly game using Pygame. 
                Since then, I have used HackerRank to find new mini-challenges. 
                I also took part in the 2021 DataFest, where we attempted to create visualisations and draw patterns from medical data.
                Currently, I am trying to develop an AI that can classify songs into music categories, based on the frequency samples from each song. 
                If you would like to see more of my projects, you can look at my <a href="https://github.com/Fayz-S" style="color:blueviolet"><b>Github</b></a>.

            <p>
                I have been passionate about music from a very young age. 
                Whenever I was in the car, my parents would always play Smooth Radio, which featured mainly 60’s and 70’s Motown and pop. 
                From there I developed a taste for rap, listening to 50 Cent, Akon and Eminem constantly. 
                I used to carry my small iPod Nano everywhere, and it didn’t take long before I had fully immersed myself in a whole spectra of music: 
                from classical Beethoven and Bach, up to the vintage blues and rags, and right up to modern hip-hop, rap and pop.
                Ask me about any of it: I’ll keep you busy for hours.
                <br><br>
                I also learned to play piano, achieving a grade 8 distinction at high school. 
                My proudest achievements however have been my musical performances. 
                My school gave me the opportunity to perform in Rent, Fame and Chicago, and I thrived on stage. 
                I also joined all the available choirs and was a key tenor in all of our performances.

                I have also always played sport.
                My dad got me into cricket at a young age, so its likely I can catch anything you throw at me.
                By high school I was swimming and rowing competitively, as well as playing rugby, hockey, and cricket.
                I won a few medals along the way, but at university I have chosen to take on Muay Thai, with swimming at the side.
                I can also lift, bro.

            <p>
                I've always seen myself as a leader. 
                I was a leading officer in my school's CCF (Combined Cadet Force), and I captained my cricket team when I played club cricket.
                Leadership and management have always come naturally to me, and i hope to end up in a management position later in my career.
